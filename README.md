# Chrome Extensions Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: August 21, 2025**

I take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how I handle your information when you use the Used Car Price Checker Chrome Extension.

## Information Collection

My Chrome extensions do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. I do not gather data that could identify you — such as your name, email address, IP address, or location. Because no information is collected, no data is shared, sold, or disclosed to third parties.

## Third-Party Links

My extensions may include links to external websites or services not operated by me. I am not responsible for the privacy practices of those third parties. I recommend reviewing the privacy policies of any external websites you visit.

## Policy Updates

I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When I make changes, I will update the Effective Date above. Any modifications are effective immediately upon posting. I encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed.

## Your Consent

By using my Chrome extension, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please discontinue use of the extension.

## Contact

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, you may contact me by [email](huang.stephen05@gmail.com).
